                    Based off a minigame inside the classic social game 'Club Penguin' comes Janken Impact! <br>
                </h1>
                <h2>A card game thematically inspired by popular game 'Genshin Impact', and mechanically by 'Card Jitsu'</h2>

                            This is a game akin to rock-paper-scissors, where you pick one element, and there's a chance
                            that the enemy will pick an element that loses to you, beats you, or is the same as yours! <br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the case of two matching elements, the higher number will win!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            While its predecessors rely more on luck to play the game,
                            Janken Impact offers you the opportunity to see your opponent's cards. <br>
                            Giving you the chance to strategise the best possible outcome!

                        <p>The game is played completely through clicks.</p>
                        <p>
                            When there is no card on the field, 
                            click any of the cards on your deck at the bottom to play it into the field.
                        </p>

                            When the round is over (when cards are on the field), 
                            click anywhere inside the canvas to start a new round.

                            A single match is composed of rounds.
                            In each round, a card chosen by both players will be pitted against the other
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Each player will be granted <strong>5 cards</strong>,
                            with a randomised element and a randomised power level. <br>

                            All cards are visible, and only one card from each deck will be chosen. <br>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The chosen card will be discarded after the round, 
                            and a new randomised card will take its place.
                        </p>

                            The winning card will grant the owner a point as its corresponding <strong>Elemental Win</strong>.
                            If it is the first time the player won with that element,
                            another point is awarded as a <strong>Unique Win</strong>.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            A winner is decided when a player has either gotten <strong>3 Elemental Wins</strong>,
                            or <strong>3 Unique Wins</strong>.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Currently, there are only three elements in the game: 
                            <span class = 'pyro'><strong></strong>Pyro</strong></span> (fire),
                            <span class = 'cryo'><strong>Cryo</strong></span> (ice), and
                            <span class = 'hydro'><strong>Hydro</strong></span>.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            All three elements are strong against one element, but weak against another.
                        </p>

                        <p>The card with the stronger element automatically wins the round,
                            but if pitted against its own element,
                            the card with the higher number wins instead.
                        </p>
